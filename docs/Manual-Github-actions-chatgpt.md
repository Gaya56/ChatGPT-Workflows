Part 1: Manual GitHub Actions Approach – Full Report
Overview

In this approach, ChatGPT guides you in writing or editing workflow files and code, but doesn’t directly push commits. You store your OpenAI API key and GitHub Access token as GitHub Actions secrets, and create a workflow that references those secrets. By manually pushing or triggering these workflows, you leverage ChatGPT (for generating or modifying code), but you remain in control of the final commits.
1. Repository & Workflow Setup

    Create a GitHub repository (like Gaya56/ChatGPT-Workflows) to hold the workflow.
    Store your secrets in the repo’s Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions (for instance OPENAI_API_KEY and GH_ACCESS_TOKEN).
    Set up the .github/workflows/ai-bot.yml file that:
        Checks out your repository.
        Installs Python and your dependencies (e.g., openai and PyGithub).
        Exposes the secrets as environment variables to a Python script.
        Runs your AI logic to create, update, or delete files in the repository.

Example snippet:

name: AI Bot Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  ai_bot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install openai PyGithub
      - name: Run AI bot script
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          GH_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        run: python scripts/ai_bot.py

2. Python Script for AI + GitHub Operations

You have a script (e.g., scripts/ai_bot.py) that:

    Retrieves OPENAI_API_KEY and GH_ACCESS_TOKEN from environment variables.
    Authenticates to GitHub with PyGithub (or raw REST requests).
    Optionally calls OpenAI APIs for text generation or user instructions.
    Performs Git operations: read, create, update, and delete files in the repository.

Example snippet:

import os
import openai
from github import Github

def main():
    openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    gh_token = os.getenv("GH_ACCESS_TOKEN")

    g = Github(gh_token)
    repo = g.get_repo("Gaya56/ChatGPT-Workflows")  # Example

    # Create or update a file
    file_path = "some_folder/new_test_file.txt"
    file_content = "Hello from the AI bot!"
    try:
        contents = repo.get_contents(file_path)
        repo.update_file(
            file_path, 
            "Update file via AI bot", 
            file_content, 
            contents.sha
        )
    except:
        repo.create_file(
            file_path, 
            "Create file via AI bot", 
            file_content
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Result:

    When you push changes to main or manually dispatch the workflow, GitHub Actions runs ai_bot.py.
    The script uses your token to commit updates to the repo.
    Security is maintained by storing keys in GitHub Actions secrets; they’re never exposed in logs.

3. Usage Flow

    Ask ChatGPT for help generating code or editing your ai_bot.py logic.
    Paste any ChatGPT-generated code into your local repository or edit it directly in GitHub.
    Push changes to GitHub or trigger the workflow from the Actions tab.
    The workflow runs, referencing the secrets and performing the desired Git/GitHub actions.
    Review the action logs to confirm successful commits.

4. Key Benefits

    Easy to set up: Doesn’t require external hosting or advanced plugin dev access.
    Secure: GitHub secrets manage your tokens.
    Guided by ChatGPT: You get ChatGPT’s assistance on code generation or debugging.
    Manual control: You decide exactly when to push or trigger the workflow.

5. Limitations

    Not fully automated: You must push code or manually dispatch the workflow; ChatGPT itself can’t run the action on demand.
    No direct conversation-based actions: You can’t just say “Hey ChatGPT, please update my_file.txt” and have it commit instantly.
    Doesn’t function as a ChatGPT plugin: It’s purely a GitHub Actions integration with a script.
